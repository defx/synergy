# Components and partials

Synergy allows you to create two types of components, _active_ and _passive_ components. Active components are the ones we've already looked at, which we will refer to simply as "components". Components are characterised primarily by the fact that they manage their own state. Passive components, on the other hand, don't manage state at all, they simply provide a template that is mixed into the parent components template, much like an HTML include. We refer to these types of components as "partials". Partials share state with the parent that includes them. Why? Because the power of components comes from the ability to break down your code into reusable chunks that can be recombined in different ways, but having to wire every single component together with props and independent state management can be time consuming to develop and maintain, and results in loading much more javascript than necessary. That why Synergy provides the option to create both components and partials, because sometimes we just want reusable chunks of HTML (and maybe also CSS). Remember, one of the key principles of good engineering design is to use the minimum number of moving parts required to achieve your goal. the fewer parts you have, the easier your design will be to build and maintain. "Less is more", as they say.
