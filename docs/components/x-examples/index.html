  <h2>What is Synergy?</h2>
  <p>Synergy is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It combines declarative data and event binding with
    functional state management and reactive updates to allow you to build all types of user interface for the web, no
    matter how simple or complex.</p>
  <p>Here's a simple example:</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
        {{ myCounter }}
    </code>
  </pre>

  <!-- @todo: consider linking to online code editor -->

  <blockquote>If you want to try Synergy out then simply copy and paste the example above into a HTML file and load it
    into your browser.</blockquote>

  <!-- @todo: include live example -->

  <p>The above example demonstrates the three core features of Synergy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Declarative data and event binding:</strong> Synergy provides a declarative template syntax that allows
        you to describe HTML output based on JavaScript state. The syntax is very simple and easy to learn.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Functional state management:</strong> Synergy allows you to describe changes to state as individual
        functions that are as easy to reason about
        as they are to test.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Reactive updates:</strong> Synergy efficiently batches updates to your HTML whenever your state changes
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
