# Getting Started

Synergy doesn't require any special toolchain, compiler, plugins etc. Its a tiny (~4k) package that gives you everything you need to start building directly in the browser.

The quickest way to get started is to import the Synergy package directly from a CDN.

## Unpkg CDN

```html
<script type="module">
  import { define } from "https://unpkg.com/synergy@7.0.4";
</script>
```

You can also install directly into your project using NPM.

## NPM

```bash
$ npm i synergy
```
