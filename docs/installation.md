# Installation

Synergy doesn't require any special toolchain, compiler, plugins etc. Its a tiny \(~4k\) package that gives you everything you need to start building directly in the browser.

The quickest way to get started is to import the Synergy package directly from a CDN.

```javascript
<script type="module">
  import { define, render } from "https://unpkg.com/synergy";
</script>
```

You can also install directly into your project using NPM.

```bash
npm i synergy
```
